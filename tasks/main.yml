# This ansible role sets up a phabricator instance using nginx + mysql.
# TODO:
# - Fix git ssh access (possibly use a dropbear listening on a different port)
#   Problem here is using a non-standard port, since it is kinda problematic to
#   move the SSH port while an ansible playbook is running. Also starting a
#   second SSHd might not be that nice, so possibly start a dropbear or similar
#   on a non-standard port.
# - Fix Arcanist access for better CLI-fu
